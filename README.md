## How to run

## Problem it solves

Most match-making apps focus on dating, limiting other social interactions. They often misuse user data, compromising privacy and safety. Additionally, connecting over shared interests or finding projects can be challenging and time-consuming. This reveals a gap: the need for a platform that enables safe, interest-based connections, free from the typical privacy concerns, and whatâ€™s culturally associated with match-making apps.

## How it works

-Create profile
-Add your interests
-Coincide with people sharing your interests
-Chat with your new friends


## Challenges during implementation

TBD

EAS
